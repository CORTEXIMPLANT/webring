# OBEY THE SYSTEM webring
Organizational repo for the OBEY THE SYSTEM webring.

## Website list
See [websites.json](websites.json) or [webring.obeythesystem.com](https://webring.obeythesystem.com).

## Wanna join?
You can open a pull request with an edit to `websites.json` with your added website. You're gonna be approved if we know you. If you don't know git or don't want to use a github account you can also message `@marta@corteximplant.com`.

## Navigation bar requirements
You must include a bar at the top of the page with a link to the previous website on the left, a link to [webring.obeythesystem.com](https://webring.obeythesystem.com) in the middle, and the next page on the right. You may style this header in a way that fits your page styling, but it must be prominently visible as a bar at the top of the page. For an example see [garden.pionaiki.com](https://garden.pionaiki.com). You may use the data structure in [websites.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CORTEXIMPLANT/webring/main/websites.json) but the bar must work without JS, so any automation must be done on the server side.
